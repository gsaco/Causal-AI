## The causal question

How do policies change outcomes when decisions are entangled with institutions, incentives, and latent confounding?

## Common failure modes without causality

- Omitted confounders distort policy conclusions.
- Fairness metrics miss path-specific effects.
- Observational correlations are mistaken for interventions.

<Claim evidence={["1703.06856", "1705.08821", "1501.01332"]}>
  Causal fairness and policy evaluation require explicit assumptions about pathways and confounders.
</Claim>

## Methods that show up a lot

- Instrumental variables and mediation analysis
- Causal fairness definitions and path-specific effects
- Sensitivity analysis for hidden confounding

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "2002.11631", "2406.04598"]} type="Signal">
  Policy evaluation work increasingly combines fairness constraints with robustness checks under shift.
</Claim>

## Benchmarks / datasets

- Use policy datasets with transparent collection pipelines and documented biases.
