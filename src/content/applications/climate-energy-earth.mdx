## The causal question

Which interventions shift long-run outcomes in complex, non-stationary systems such as energy grids or climate processes?

## Common failure modes without causality

- Non-stationarity masquerades as causal effect.
- Exogenous shocks invalidate learned policies.
- Aggregated metrics hide local interventions.

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1501.01332", "1705.08821"]}>
  Robust inference under distribution shift is essential before attributing policy impact in climate-scale systems.
</Claim>

## Methods that show up a lot

- Invariant risk minimization and shift-aware estimation
- Causal time series and spatiotemporal modeling
- Counterfactual policy evaluation

<Claim evidence={["2002.02770", "2404.06349", "1803.01422"]} type="Signal">
  Recent work blends causal discovery with structured temporal modeling to support intervention analysis at scale.
</Claim>

## Benchmarks / datasets

- Prefer public policy or climate intervention datasets with documented causal assumptions.
