## The causal question

Which interventions change biological outcomes, and how can we design experiments that identify causal mechanisms?

## Common failure modes without causality

- Confounding between measurement processes and biological signal.
- Distribution shift across labs or assays.
- Counterfactuals are claimed without causal identification.

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1705.08821", "1501.01332"]}>
  Causal discovery and effect estimation are required to distinguish mechanism from correlation in biological data.
</Claim>

## Methods that show up a lot

- Causal discovery with latent confounding
- Generative models with intervention-aware constraints
- Counterfactual evaluation for experiments

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "2305.10032", "2406.04598"]} type="Signal">
  Biology and genomics research increasingly stress robustness across assays and intervention-aware evaluation.
</Claim>

## Benchmarks / datasets

- Use datasets with explicit intervention metadata and experimental controls.
