## The causal question

Which treatment or intervention changes patient outcomes, under real-world shifts in population, measurement, and policy?

## Common failure modes without causality

- Confounding in observational cohorts misleads effect estimates.
- Treatment policies drift over time, invalidating static predictors.
- Proxy outcomes obscure the real intervention target.

<Claim evidence={["1705.08821", "1501.01332", "1907.02893"]}>
  Treatment effects are sensitive to hidden confounding and distribution shift, making purely predictive models brittle
  when deployed in changing clinical settings.
</Claim>

## Methods that show up a lot

- Causal effect estimation and counterfactual prediction
- Sensitivity analysis and robustness under shift
- Causal discovery for observational data audit

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "2011.04216", "2305.10032"]} type="Signal">
  Clinical workflows increasingly combine structure learning, estimation toolkits, and audit pipelines to justify
  interventions before deployment.
</Claim>

## Benchmarks / datasets

- Use evidence-backed clinical benchmarks when available; avoid claiming clinical validity without explicit trials.
