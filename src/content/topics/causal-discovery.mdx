## Field guide

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1907.02893"]}>
  Causal Discovery focuses on learning causal graphs from observational or interventional data, with explicit identifiability assumptions, and relies on explicit assumptions before interpreting effects.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1705.08821"]} type="Signal">
  Recent work in Causal Discovery emphasizes robustness checks and transparent reporting of causal assumptions.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1907.02893"]} type="Debate">
  A recurring debate in Causal Discovery concerns how much identifiability can be claimed without interventions.
</Claim>

## Evaluation cues

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1705.08821"]} type="Metric">
  Evaluation often uses synthetic interventions or held-out environments, which can miss deployment shifts in Causal Discovery.
</Claim>

## Open problems

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1907.02893"]} type="Open Question">
  Open question: which minimal assumptions are sufficient to estimate effects in Causal Discovery under realistic data constraints?
</Claim>

## Common pitfalls / Do not overclaim

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1907.02893"]} type="Warning">
  Pitfall: treating predictive accuracy as evidence of causal validity within Causal Discovery.
</Claim>

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Correlation alone is not evidence of intervention effects in Causal Discovery.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming causal impact without stating the estimand, assumptions, and sensitivity checks.
