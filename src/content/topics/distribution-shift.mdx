<Claim evidence={["1501.01332"]} type="Debate">
  Invariant causal prediction identifies causal parents by testing invariance across environments, but demands enough heterogeneity to distinguish causal from spurious predictors.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893"]} type="Claim">
  Invariant Risk Minimization proposes optimizing for predictors whose risk-optimal classifiers are invariant across environments.
