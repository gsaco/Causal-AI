## Field guide

<Claim evidence={["1501.01332", "1907.02893"]}>
  Distribution Shift & Invariance focuses on leveraging environment changes to find stable causal structure and predictors, and relies on explicit assumptions before interpreting effects.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1803.01422"]} type="Signal">
  Recent work in Distribution Shift & Invariance emphasizes robustness checks and transparent reporting of causal assumptions.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["1501.01332", "1907.02893"]} type="Debate">
  A recurring debate in Distribution Shift & Invariance concerns how much identifiability can be claimed without interventions.
</Claim>

## Evaluation cues

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1803.01422"]} type="Metric">
  Evaluation often uses synthetic interventions or held-out environments, which can miss deployment shifts in Distribution Shift & Invariance.
</Claim>

## Open problems

<Claim evidence={["1501.01332", "1907.02893"]} type="Open Question">
  Open question: which minimal assumptions are sufficient to estimate effects in Distribution Shift & Invariance under realistic data constraints?
</Claim>

## Common pitfalls / Do not overclaim

<Claim evidence={["1501.01332", "1907.02893"]} type="Warning">
  Pitfall: treating predictive accuracy as evidence of causal validity within Distribution Shift & Invariance.
</Claim>

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Correlation alone is not evidence of intervention effects in Distribution Shift & Invariance.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming causal impact without stating the estimand, assumptions, and sensitivity checks.
