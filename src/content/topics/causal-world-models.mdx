## Field guide

<Claim evidence={["2404.06349", "1803.01422"]}>
  Causal World Models focuses on world models that encode causal structure for planning and intervention reasoning, and relies on explicit assumptions before interpreting effects.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1907.02893"]} type="Signal">
  Recent work in Causal World Models emphasizes robustness checks and transparent reporting of causal assumptions.
</Claim>

<Claim evidence={["2404.06349", "1803.01422"]} type="Debate">
  A recurring debate in Causal World Models concerns how much identifiability can be claimed without interventions.
</Claim>

## Evaluation cues

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1907.02893"]} type="Metric">
  Evaluation often uses synthetic interventions or held-out environments, which can miss deployment shifts in Causal World Models.
</Claim>

## Open problems

<Claim evidence={["2404.06349", "1803.01422"]} type="Open Question">
  Open question: which minimal assumptions are sufficient to estimate effects in Causal World Models under realistic data constraints?
</Claim>

## Common pitfalls / Do not overclaim

<Claim evidence={["2404.06349", "1803.01422"]} type="Warning">
  Pitfall: treating predictive accuracy as evidence of causal validity within Causal World Models.
</Claim>

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Correlation alone is not evidence of intervention effects in Causal World Models.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming causal impact without stating the estimand, assumptions, and sensitivity checks.
