## What's emerging

<Claim evidence={["1705.08821", "2011.04216", "2002.11631"]}>
  There is growing interest in causal estimation pipelines that operate under privacy or data minimization constraints.
</Claim>

## What's still missing

- Evidence that privacy-preserving causal estimators maintain identifiability.
- Shared benchmarks that balance utility and disclosure risk.

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1703.06856", "2404.06349"]} type="Warning">
  Fairness and privacy constraints can change the causal estimand, and are not interchangeable with standard metrics.
</Claim>

## Signals to watch

- Interventional datasets with privacy-preserving releases.
- Tooling that documents estimands and data minimization choices.

## Related topics / trails

- Causal fairness
- Systems & tooling

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Emerging signals are not guarantees of impact.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming deployment readiness without evidence-backed evaluation.
