## What's emerging

<Claim evidence={["2010.05761", "2307.16405", "1803.01422"]}>
  Agentic systems are increasingly evaluated on counterfactual planning and intervention reliability, not only task
  success under static policies.
</Claim>

## What's still missing

- Strong evidence that agent policies generalize under real-world shifts.
- Transparent evaluation protocols for intervention safety.

<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1705.08821", "2404.06349"]} type="Warning">
  Robustness under distribution shift remains a known gap for agentic interventions.
</Claim>

## Signals to watch

- Papers combining causal discovery with tool-augmented planning.
- Benchmarks that evaluate counterfactual reasoning with interventions.

## Related topics / trails

- Causal RL
- Off-policy evaluation

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Emerging signals are not guarantees of impact.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming deployment readiness without evidence-backed evaluation.
