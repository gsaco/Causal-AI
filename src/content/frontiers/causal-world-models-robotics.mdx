## What's emerging

<Claim evidence={["2010.05761", "1803.01422", "2511.22842"]}>
  Robotics research is linking structure learning with world models to support intervention-aware planning.
</Claim>

## What's still missing

- Strong safety guarantees for interventions in open-world settings.
- Evaluation data that reflects real sensor and actuator failures.

<Claim evidence={["1501.01332", "1907.02893", "2404.06349"]} type="Warning">
  Distribution shifts between simulators and deployment remain a primary risk for causal world models.
</Claim>

## Signals to watch

- Benchmarks with explicit intervention logs.
- Hybrid causal + mechanistic world models.

## Related topics / trails

- Off-policy evaluation
- Causal discovery

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Emerging signals are not guarantees of impact.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming deployment readiness without evidence-backed evaluation.
