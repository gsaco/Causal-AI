## What's emerging

<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1705.08821", "2305.10032"]}>
  Scientific discovery pipelines increasingly pair causal discovery with intervention-aware experiments.
</Claim>

## What's still missing

- Benchmarks that connect causal structure to real-world interventions.
- Shared standards for uncertainty in mechanistic claims.

<Claim evidence={["1501.01332", "1907.02893", "2406.04598"]} type="Warning">
  Robustness to distribution shift remains a major barrier to causal scientific claims.
</Claim>

## Signals to watch

- Cross-domain benchmarks with intervention metadata.
- Hybrid mechanistic + statistical causal models.

## Related topics / trails

- Causal generative models
- Counterfactuals

## Guardrails

- What this does NOT prove: Emerging signals are not guarantees of impact.
- Common misstatements: Avoid claiming deployment readiness without evidence-backed evaluation.
