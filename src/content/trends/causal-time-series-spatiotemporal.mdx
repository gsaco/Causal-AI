<Claim evidence={["2404.06349", "1907.02893"]} type="Claim">
  Temporal causal modeling is expanding beyond static datasets, with more focus on intervention timing and shift.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Spatiotemporal interventions expose fragility in models that assume stationarity, pushing evaluation into multi-environment settings.

## Core ideas

- Interventions must be aligned with temporal dynamics.
- Shift-aware evaluation is essential for forecasting policy effects.
