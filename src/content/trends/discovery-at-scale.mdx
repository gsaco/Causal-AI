<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "1501.01332"]} type="Claim">
  Continuous optimization and invariance-based reasoning are the dominant levers for scaling causal discovery.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Scaling discovery requires balancing identifiability with practical optimization, making approximate methods the default.

## Core ideas

- Smooth constraints allow gradient-based discovery.
- Invariance cues help disambiguate competing causal graphs.
