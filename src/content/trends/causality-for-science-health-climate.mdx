<Claim evidence={["1803.01422", "2305.10032"]} type="Claim">
  Scientific workflows increasingly use causal discovery and effect estimation to prioritize interventions.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Causal methods are now part of the evidence chain for scientific interventions, not just exploratory analysis.

## Core ideas

- Interventions must be tied to mechanistic hypotheses.
- Robustness under shift is required before policy or clinical translation.
