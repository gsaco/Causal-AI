<Claim evidence={["1703.06856", "2011.04216"]} type="Claim">
  Fairness audits are increasingly paired with causal tooling to operationalize counterfactual criteria.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Practical toolchains are lowering the barrier to testing counterfactual fairness at scale, but still demand transparent assumptions.

## Core ideas

- Causal effect estimators underpin fairness diagnostics.
- Tooling makes evidence trails and refutation steps explicit.
