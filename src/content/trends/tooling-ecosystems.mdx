<Claim evidence={["2011.04216", "1705.08821"]} type="Claim">
  Causal tooling ecosystems now prioritize auditability, evidence trails, and refutation workflows.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Tooling reduces the friction of causal analysis but can obscure assumptions if not documented.

## Core ideas

- Toolkits encode estimands, assumptions, and sensitivity checks.
- Reproducibility requires transparent provenance.
