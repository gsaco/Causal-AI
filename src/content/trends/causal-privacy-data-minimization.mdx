<Claim evidence={["2002.11631", "2011.04216"]} type="Claim">
  Privacy-aware causal pipelines must expose estimands and assumptions explicitly to avoid false guarantees.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Regulatory pressure is forcing causal teams to operate with limited data access and higher transparency.

## Core ideas

- Data minimization changes the estimand.
- Tooling must document privacy constraints alongside causal assumptions.
