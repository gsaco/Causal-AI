<Claim evidence={["1907.02893", "1501.01332"]} type="Claim">
  Invariant prediction objectives are now the backbone of robust causal representation learning under distribution shift.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

Recent work focuses on encoding invariance directly in representation learning rather than relying on post-hoc adjustments, making cross-domain generalization more predictable.

## Core ideas

- Invariance can be enforced via objectives that align predictors across environments.
- Representation stability reduces dependence on shortcut features.
