<Claim evidence={["2404.06349", "2511.22842"]} type="Claim">
  Robotics research is increasingly combining causal discovery with world models to support intervention planning.
</Claim>

## What changed & why it matters

World models must now support intervention reasoning, not only prediction, to meet safety demands in robotics.

## Core ideas

- Intervention-aware state transitions improve transfer.
- Evaluation should include counterfactual failure analysis.
